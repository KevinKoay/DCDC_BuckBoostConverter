# DCDC_BuckBoostConverter

Data-Driven Model Predictive Control (DDMPC) are considered for controlling a DC to DC Buck-Boost converter with an active load. 

The ffour control methods are: 
  1. PI Controller 
  2. PPO 
  3. Hybrid 1 (PPO with PI controller)
  4. Hybrid 2 (PPO with filtering mechanism)

The Simulink .slx files contain the simulation models and the MATLAB .m scripts are used to simulate the respective control methods.
